# PseudoBusy

###What
PreusoBusy is a script to make your terminal look busy.
It finds random files on your computer and prints them out letter by letter, with varying speed and IDA-like highlighting.


###Run
```
python pseudoBusy.py
```

###Build
You don't have to build PseudoBusy, but it can be nice having a single file to move around.

######Note: This might be dangerous
To build:
```
sh make
```

To run:
```
./PseudoBusy
```

###Issues
- [x] Works on Linux completely

- [ ] Probably works on Windows, but colors are disabled

- [ ] Probably works on OSX, but only looks at files in local directory
