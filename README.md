# PseudoBusy

###What
PseudoBusy is a script to make your terminal look busy.
It recursively finds random interesting files on your computer and prints them out letter by letter, with varying speed, IDE-like highlighting, and random mistakes.

Works nicely as a noninvasive, nonintensive, screen saver.

###Run
```
python pseudoBusy.py
```

###Build
You don't have to build PseudoBusy, but it can be nice having a single file to move around.

######Note: This might be dangerous
To build:
```
sh make
```

To run:
```
./PseudoBusy
```

###Issues

######No major issues at the moment; all platforms have as much functionality as they support

- [x] Works on Linux completely

- [x] Works on Windows, but ANSI colors are disabled and make won't work, of course

- [x] Works on OSX, seemingly with full functionality
